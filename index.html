            Welcome to my humble abode! AS you can almost definitely see, this is my website, while also being my portfolio for a class that I am taking.
            <br>
            <br>
            Let me introduce myself, my name is Jonathan Gonzalez. A young, sociable man. I am currently attenting University at Florida Gulf Coast University.
            Based in SouthWest Florida. <br> But I wasn't born here, no. I was born 1000's of miles away. In the capital of Canada, Ottawa.
            <br>
            I enjoy most sports. With favourites being baseball, ping-pong, badminton and hockey. But you'll never catch me playing football.

         <h4>Notes and Credits</h4>
         <p><b>Sound</b> <br>
             I modified the "gwa gwa gwa" constantly repeated by the warrior in audacity. 
              It has the mp3. format because .mp3 files ave a lot of space and are the most well supported audio file. 
            I might have used the .wav if it didn't take up so much space. Even if it is an exact copy of the original audio. 
              That isn't necessary for this project.
            I imported the sound into Audacity and copy-pasted it 3 times, creating a different effect for each version. 
              The first being the original sound, the second being in a high er pitch, and the last being distorted.
          <br>
        <b>Vector Image</b>
            I created the warrior in the 'Paint New Sprite'. It was created using the .svg file format. 
              As .svg files compared to .jpg files do not lose their quality.
            I shaped his body carefully using the vector style of drawing.
             <br> Vector graphics, unlike bitmap or raster graphics which are defined as a set of pixels,
              instead use code to describe a graphic and my or anybodies computer will then read that code and render a graphic from it. 
          <br>
        <b>Logical Operators</b>
           The use of Logical operators is used to end the game. There is an 'and' and 'or' operator inside of the game. 
               They were used in the bat sprite as it was the item needed to be collected.
          Logical Operators or Boolean/ Binary are basic operations that direct the flow of computing towards different results.
                It is used to analyze and simplify the digital/ logic circuits. It uses only the binary numbers 0 and 1. 
                At the centre of Boolean Logic is the idea that all values are either true or false. 
              The use of Boolean Logic allows for the creation of more complex definitions, allowing for coders to build a very specific set of definitions.
          <br>Number systems are different ways to represent numbers on computers, different systems are used in different systems. 
              Thus being important to be able to distinguish and convert systems with one another.
