If you really wanted to know. I did start this repository a few days before it was due. In the most stupid decision I could've made. It has been fun making my first website in 3 days. And having to hand it in on the 3rd. Hoping for a 100. Most of my time was spent on w3schools looking up a specific function for html, css or javascript. Or messing around with the CSS looking for the right look. 

The html looked terrible at first. My professor really knows what hes doing. I used some links that he gave the class to revamp and clean the code to make it look nicer. I also got into a habit of having those in betweens to explain what I was doing. Even if html, css and javascript are generally easy to read to other coders. WHy not make a good habit of it now rather than later.
